Since the JavaFX Text control is a subclass of the JavaFX Shape class, the Text class has all the same methods available that other JavaFX Shape objects do - e.g. fill and stroke color and style.

The JavaFX Text control is also a subclass of the JavaFX Node class, so the Text class also has all the same methods available as any other JavaFX Node has, meaning you can set effects on it etc.]]></text>
