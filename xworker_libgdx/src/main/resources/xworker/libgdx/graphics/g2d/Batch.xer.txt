#$@text#$@
<p><span style="background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255); color:rgb(71, 71, 71)">A Batch is used to draw 2D rectangles that reference a texture (region). The class will batch the drawing commands and optimize them for processing by the GPU.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">To draw something with a Batch one has to first call the <a href="http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/nightlies/docs/api/com/badlogic/gdx/graphics/g2d/Batch.html#begin--" style="color: blue; text-decoration: none;"><code>begin()</code></a> method which will setup appropriate render states. When you are done with drawing you have to call <a href="http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/nightlies/docs/api/com/badlogic/gdx/graphics/g2d/Batch.html#end--" style="color: blue; text-decoration: none;"><code>end()</code></a> which will actually draw the things you specified.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">All drawing commands of the Batch operate in screen coordinates. The screen coordinate system has an x-axis pointing to the right, an y-axis pointing upwards and the origin is in the lower left corner of the screen. You can also provide your own transformation and projection matrices if you so wish.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">A Batch is managed. In case the OpenGL context is lost all OpenGL resources a Batch uses internally get invalidated. A context is lost when a user switches to another application or receives an incoming call on Android. A Batch will be automatically reloaded after the OpenGL context is restored.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">A Batch is a pretty heavy object so you should only ever have one in your program.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">A Batch works with OpenGL ES 1.x and 2.0. In the case of a 2.0 context it will use its own custom shader to draw all provided sprites. You can set your own custom shader via <a href="http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/nightlies/docs/api/com/badlogic/gdx/graphics/g2d/Batch.html#setShader-com.badlogic.gdx.graphics.glutils.ShaderProgram-" style="color: blue; text-decoration: none;"><code>setShader(ShaderProgram)</code></a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">A Batch has to be disposed if it is no longer used.</p>
